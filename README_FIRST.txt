## 🔐 StegVerse Token Vault (TV)

The **StegVerse Token Vault (TV)** is a **security-critical subsystem** responsible for the protection, governance, and controlled distribution of privileged secrets, capabilities, and role-based access across the StegVerse ecosystem.

Access to the TV carries **explicit custodial responsibility**.  
All contributors—human or AI—operate under the **Guardian Oath**, a mandatory ethical and procedural framework designed to protect people, truth, and system integrity.

### 🧠 Core Operating Principles
The Token Vault is governed by a *Guardian-first* approach:

- **Least privilege** and **short-lived access**
- **Auditability and provenance** of actions affecting trust or security
- **Survivor-protective and whistleblower-safe** ethical alignment
- **Reversible, measurable, and accountable** operational design

> The role of a custodian is not to *control* access, but to **protect the people and truths that access can impact**.
