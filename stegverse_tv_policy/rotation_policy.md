Principles
- Prefer short-lived tokens (<= 60 minutes).
- Rotate static keys (if any) every 30 days.
- Revoke and reissue on role/policy changes.

Cadence
- Review roles/issuers quarterly.
- Rotate OSINT API keys monthly where possible.
- Audit TV access logs monthly.

Incident Response
- If compromise suspected: revoke affected roles immediately; audit and re-issue.
