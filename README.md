# 🧱 StegVerse Token Vault (TV)

![TV Audit Status](docs/tv_status.svg)

**Token Vault (TV)** is the secure cryptographic backbone of the StegVerse ecosystem —  
a self-verifying audit chain that ensures every change, credential, and transaction  
remains *authentic, auditable, and sovereign*.

TV is designed for AI-driven infrastructure and human governance alike — each workflow  
signs, verifies, and logs its activity into an append-only `chainlog.jsonl`,  
which in turn drives automated audit reports and the status badge above.
