# TV Verify Integrity Workflow (Manual Run Fix)

This version includes:
- A **manual Run button** that appears even on iPhone/Safari.
- Correct YAML syntax (fixed indentation at line 47).
- Self-contained verification flow with no secrets required.

## How to Trigger Manually
1. Go to: https://github.com/StegVerse/TV/actions/workflows/tv_verify_integrity.yml
2. Ensure the **main** branch is selected.
3. Tap **Run workflow** at the top right.
4. Confirm the default input ("manual").
5. Watch it run in the Actions tab!
