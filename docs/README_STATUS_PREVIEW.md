# TV Status Badge (Preview)

This is a static preview of the TV audit badge so you can see it in your README before the first live audit.

- File: `docs/tv_status.svg` (place this there for preview)
- Once your workflows run, the **tv_status_badge** workflow will overwrite it with a live badge.

Usage in README:

```md
![TV Audit Status](docs/tv_status.svg)
```
